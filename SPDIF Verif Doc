SPDIF traffic generator:

The purpose of this UVC is:
-	Generate random SPDIF, using Manchester coding.
-	Stop traffic at any time with in Block or Frame.
-	Generate non Manchester coding
-	Monitor SPDIF traffic, detect the clock frequency and convert it to parallel data.
The different configuration of the traffic generator is described below:
•	Block number (block_nb)
•	Clean stop of the traffic (clean_stop)
•	In Frame stop (in_frame_stop)
•	In Block stop (in_block_stop)
•	Dirty stop of the traffic (in_frame_stop)
•	Manchester coding (coding_type, 1 when machester)
Spdif Monitor:
•	Detect SPDIF clock frequency.
•	Convert data from SPDIF to Parallel
Checker:
•	 Check Frame length
•	Check Block length
•	Check Frame kind
Coverage:
•	clean_stop_e
•	in_block_stop_e
•	in_frame_stop_e
Sequence library:
•	Simple seq:  it sends a block without any interrupts within it and with Manchester coding.
•	 spdif_no_traffic_seq:no traffic is generated
•	spdif_clean_stop_seq: Traffic stopped in a clean way
•	spdif_in_frame_stop_seq: Traffic stopped inside  Frame
•	spdif_in_block_stop_seq: Traffic stopped inside a Block.
•	spdif_no_stop_seq: No stop in traffic.
•	spdif_man_coding_seq: Manchester coding traffic.


You can add as many sequences and tests as you want, also you can add checkers , cover points, …

To run this example you need Mentor Modelsim.
1.	 Open Modelsim
2.	Compil the RTL if any.
3.	Go under “run” directory
4.	source  “launch_run_questa_gui”
5.	Enjoy!
